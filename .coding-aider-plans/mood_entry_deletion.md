# [Coding Aider Plan] Mood Entry Deletion Feature

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a feature that allows users to delete individual mood entries from the history page of the mood tracker application. This functionality is important for correcting errors in mood entries.

## Problem Description
Currently, the mood tracker application allows users to record their moods and view their mood history, but there is no way to delete individual entries if a user makes an error. This limitation means that incorrect entries remain in the database permanently, potentially affecting the accuracy of the user's mood history.

## Goals
1. Add a delete button next to each mood entry in the history page
2. Implement a backend route to handle the deletion of specific mood entries
3. Ensure users receive confirmation before deleting an entry to prevent accidental deletions
4. Redirect users back to the history page after deletion

## Implementation Details
1. Create a new route in app.py to handle the deletion of mood entries by ID
2. Ensure the history route includes the entry ID in the data passed to the template
3. Update the history.html template to include a delete button for each entry
4. Add a confirmation dialog before deletion to prevent accidental deletions

## Additional Notes and Constraints
- The deletion should be permanent and not recoverable
- The implementation should maintain the existing UI style and user experience
- The feature should work with the existing database schema without requiring migrations
