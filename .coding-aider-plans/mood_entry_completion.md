# [Coding Aider Plan] Mood Entry Deletion Feature Completion

## Overview
This plan documents the successful implementation and testing of the mood entry deletion feature for the mood tracker application. The feature allows users to delete individual mood entries from the history page.

## Completed Implementation
1. ✅ Backend Implementation:
   - Created a route in app.py to handle deletion of mood entries by ID
   - Implemented database query to delete the specified entry
   - Added redirect back to history page after deletion

2. ✅ Frontend Implementation:
   - Updated history.html to include entry ID in the displayed data
   - Added delete button for each mood entry in the history page
   - Implemented confirmation dialog before deletion

3. ✅ Testing:
   - Tested deletion of entries from the history page
   - Verified that only the selected entry is deleted
   - Confirmed that the user is redirected back to the history page after deletion
   - Tested the confirmation dialog to ensure it prevents accidental deletions

## Results
The mood entry deletion feature has been successfully implemented and tested. Users can now delete individual mood entries from their history, which improves the overall usability of the application by allowing correction of erroneous entries.

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding a "bulk delete" option for removing multiple entries at once
- Implement an "undo" feature for accidental deletions
- Add user authentication to prevent unauthorized deletion of entries
